# todoer

## About

todoer is a python script that takes your code as an input, parses it looking for comments that contain predefined tags such as `TODO:` or `FIXME:` and generates a todo list of these comments.

## Wishlist

- [ ] get it to work with block comments (regex?)
- [x] show line numbers
- [x] markdown output
- [x] make output filename argument optional
- [ ] turn this into a VSCode extension?
